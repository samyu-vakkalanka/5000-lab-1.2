It requires baking a cake to the perfect thickness, letting it cool to the right temperature before frosting it, and rolling the cake carefully without breaking it.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt, then set aside. In a large bowl, cream the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n\nSource for columns: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74162212/two-columns-layout-in-quarto"
